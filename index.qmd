Hi, my name is Margarita, I am a data analyst with a strong foundation in research and hold a PhD in Molecular Virology. I have experience analyzing large datasets from questionnaires and experimental measurements. During my research, I honed my skills in statistical analysis, data visualization, project management, and problem-solving to tackle complex scientific questions using data. I'm proficient in spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, Looker Studio, PowerBI and R. My passion lies in transforming raw data into insights that can drive informed decision-making.
