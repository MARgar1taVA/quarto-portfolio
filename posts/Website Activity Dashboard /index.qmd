# Website Activity Dashboard

This dashboard consists of website activity mock data from a fictional company called "*Bicycle Empire*". This project was a technical exercise I submitted for a company where I was interviewing for a **PowerBI analyst** position. The exercise consisted on recreating all the main elements of the **Reference Dashboard** they sent me and to add a few of my own figures and elements. The dashboard in the right is the one made and submitted back to them.

Since I don't have the paid version of PowerBI, I share a few screenshots of the project.

The requirements they gave consisted of the following **KPI's**, calculated measures, and elements:

<div>

1\) **Reach**: calculated as the distinct count of Cust_id.

2\) **Reach WoW**: % change in reach (week over week).

a\. If the number is negative, the number must automatically change to red. If it is positive it should be green.

b\. The number must be dynamic and always show the comparison of the last week selected vs the previous week.

3\) **Impressions**: count of cust_id where activity classification = Impression.

4\) **Impressions WoW**: % change in Impressions (week over week).

a\. If the number is negative, the number must automatically change to red. If it is positive it should be green.

b\. The number must be dynamic and always show the comparison of the last week selected vs the previous week.

5\) **Cumulative Reach**: Ongoing accumulation of the Reach measure.

6\) **Data through**: Should show the latest date from the selected date range.

</div>

### About the Data

They sent me three csv files one with the *Fact Table*, and two Dimension tables for the *Activity Classification* and *Brand Category*. I loaded the files int to Power Bi and proceeded to inspect and clean the data.

**Fact Table:**

```{r}
#| label: read-data
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv(file = "Data.csv")

data
```

**Activity Classification:**

```{r}
#| label: act_data
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

activity <- read_csv(file = "Activity Classification.csv")
brand <- read_csv(file = "Brand - Category.csv")

activity
```

**Brand Classification:**

```{r}
#| label: brand_data
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

brand <- read_csv(file = "Brand - Category.csv")

brand
```

### Data Cleaning

To clean the data and for the ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process, the following instructions were given:

**ETL:**

1)  Identify and remove unecessary columns to make the data load faster

2)  clean the brand name

3)  Remove "0" in Cust_ids

4)  Check data types and headers

5)  Remove duplicated if necessary

**Table and relationships:**

1)  Create a calendar Table. Add a "Start of the Week" column and use it for the main chart

2)  Create the necessary relationships between tables

**Measures and Columns:**

1)  Create the necessary measures to show all the KPI's in the reference dashboard.

2)  Create a calculated column for tier in the category table using this information:

| Category   | Tier   |
|------------|--------|
| Andromeda  | Top    |
| Whirlpool  | Top    |
| Triangulum | Middle |
| Black Hawk | Middle |
| Centaurus  | Low    |
| Starfish   | Low    |

From all the instructions above I proceeded to clean the data in the **Power Query Editor**, deleting a few unnecessary columns and filtering out rows with 0 in the field Cust_id. I cleaned the Brand column by extracting the name before the "-" and replaced the name "Kronus" for "Cronus". After checking that the data types of all columns were correct, i closed the editor and in the Table View I proceeded to create a **Calendar Table** and a table to store the calculated measurements. I also added a new column to the Brand Classification table to add the Tier Category using the formula **SWITCH()**.

In the **Model View** I properly connected all the tables using a **Star Schema** and proceeded to do the calculations for the required KPI's.

### Dashboard 

After finishing all the asked requirements, including all the filters, I reviewed the data to understand what other information could be useful to the hypothetical business. I already had metrics for Reach and Impressions, but decided to also add the metrics for Engagement, I also added bar charts to view all three metrics by Country and by Brand. 

After confirming all metrics were dynamic and all filters worked properly, the final step was to arrange the design for the KPI's, select colors for my categories and add a background.
