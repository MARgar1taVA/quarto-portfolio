My name is Margarita, I am a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in science and hold a PhD in Molecular Virology. I have experience analyzing large datasets from questionnaires and experimental measurements. During my research, I honed my skills in statistical analysis, data visualization, project management, and problem-solving to tackle complex scientific questions using data. I'm proficient in spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau/Looker Studio, and R. My passion lies in transforming raw data into insights that can drive informed decision-making.
